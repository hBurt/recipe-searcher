IMPORTANT, ALL NEW ACTIVITYS MUST BE ADDED TO THE MANIFEST FILE
IMPORTANT, DO NOT EXCEED 50 TOTAL REQUESTS PER DAY
**API required a subscription for freemium APIs so I (Angelo) will unsubscribe when the class is finished**
**As long as we do not exceed 50 requests a day there is no charge, I WILL BE WATCHING**
**Each Search is 2 requests, one for the base search, then another for finding the information**
